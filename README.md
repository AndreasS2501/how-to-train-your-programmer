"Six blind sages were shown an elephant and met to discuss their ex- perience. “It’s wonderful,” said the first, “an elephant is like a rope: slender and flexible.” “No, no, not at all,” said the second, “an ele- phant is like a tree: sturdily planted on the ground.” “Marvelous,” said the third, “an elephant is like a wall.” “Incredible,” said the fourth, “an elephant is a tube filled with water.” “What a strange piecemeal beast this is,” said the fifth. “Strange indeed,” said the sixth, “but there must be some underlying harmony. Let us investi- gate the matter further.”
– Freely adapted from a traditional Indian fable."

"One approach to study computer programming is to study programming lan- guages. But there are a tremendously large number of languages, so large that it is impractical to study them all. How can we tackle this immensity? We could pick a small number of languages that are representative of different programming paradigms. But this gives little insight into programming as a unified discipline. This book uses another approach."
