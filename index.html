          "The real problem in speech is not precise language. The problem is clear language. The desire is to have the idea clearly communicated to the other person. It is only necessary to be precise when there is some doubt as to the meaning of a phrase, and then the precision should be put in the place where the doubt exists. It is really quite impossible to say anything with absolute precision, unless that thing is so abstracted from the real world as to not represent any real thing." - Richard Feynman

          "Six blind sages were shown an elephant and met to discuss their ex- perience. “It’s wonderful,” said the first, “an elephant is like a rope: slender and flexible.” “No, no, not at all,” said the second, “an ele- phant is like a tree: sturdily planted on the ground.” “Marvelous,” said the third, “an elephant is like a wall.” “Incredible,” said the fourth, “an elephant is a tube filled with water.” “What a strange piecemeal beast this is,” said the fifth. “Strange indeed,” said the sixth, “but there must be some underlying harmony. Let us investi- gate the matter further.”
          – Freely adapted from a traditional Indian fable."

        <p>
          "One approach to study computer programming is to study programming lan- guages. But there are a tremendously large number of languages, so large that it is impractical to study them all. How can we tackle this immensity? We could pick a small number of languages that are representative of different programming paradigms. But this gives little insight into programming as a unified discipline. This book uses another approach."

          "It is the transcendent (or 'abstract' or 'self-contained') nature of music that the new so called concretism--Pop Art, eighteen-hour slices-of-reality films, musique concrete--opposes. But instead of bringing art and reality closer together, the new movement merely thins out the distinction." - Igor Stravinksy
